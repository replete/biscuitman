		<p>Biscuits, the beloved treats that accompany tea time, snack breaks, and dessert cravings. In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the world of biscuits, exploring their history, varieties, and cultural significance.</p>

		<h2>History of Biscuits</h2>
		<p>The origins of biscuits trace back centuries, with evidence of early biscuit-like snacks dating back to ancient civilizations. However, the modern biscuit, as we know it today, evolved during the Middle Ages in Europe. Initially, biscuits were hard, dry baked goods made primarily from flour, water, and sometimes sugar.</p>
		<p>Over time, biscuit recipes diversified, incorporating various ingredients such as butter, eggs, and flavorings. The Industrial Revolution further transformed biscuit production, enabling mass manufacturing and distribution.</p>

		<h2>Popular Biscuit Varieties</h2>
		<h3>Rich Tea</h3>
		<p>Rich tea biscuits are renowned for their delicate texture and subtle sweetness. Originating in the United Kingdom, rich tea biscuits are often enjoyed dunked in tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. These biscuits are commonly round-shaped with pin-prick patterns on the surface.</p>

		<h3>Hobnobs</h3>
		<p>Hobnobs, a staple in British biscuit assortments, boast a hearty oat flavor and a satisfying crunch. These biscuits are distinguishable by their rough texture and thick consistency, making them ideal for dunking or enjoying on their own.</p>

		<h3>Custard Creams</h3>
		<p>Custard creams are classic sandwich biscuits consisting of two layers of biscuit with a creamy, custard-flavored filling in between. With their nostalgic appeal and comforting taste, custard creams are a favorite among both children and adults.</p>

		<h3>Bourbons</h3>
		<p>Bourbons are distinctive chocolate sandwich biscuits featuring a dark chocolate-flavored filling sandwiched between two chocolate biscuits. Named after the French royal house of Bourbon, these biscuits offer a rich and indulgent treat for chocolate lovers.</p>

		<h3>Jaffa Cakes</h3>
		<p>While technically not biscuits but often included in biscuit assortments, Jaffa Cakes are a beloved snack consisting of a sponge cake base topped with a layer of orange-flavored jelly and coated in chocolate. The combination of tangy orange and rich chocolate makes Jaffa Cakes a delightful treat for any occasion.</p>
